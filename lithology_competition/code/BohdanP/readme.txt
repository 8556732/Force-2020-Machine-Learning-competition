Steps to get prediction for the new test file

Unizp pred.zip file and go to the directory with unpacked files and directories.

Create and start virtual environment:

python3 -m venv venv/

source venv/bin/activate

Install required packages:

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

In the file stack_pred.py, set up the path to file with test set and to the file with predictions which will be generated by this script.

Run the script stack_pred.py:

python3 stack_pred.py

Deactivate virtual environment:
 
deactivate

The script will create a file with predictions which are based on the pre-trained models   which are placed in the models directory. It can take several minutes.

Machine learning predictive models and stacking models based on logistic regression 
can be created from scratch using jupyter notebook lgb_cv_stack.ipynb. It can take several hours.
